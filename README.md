# Algorithmic Machine Learning
----------
Data Science portfolio of ipython notebooks implementing several Machine Learning algorithms following a structured, well-organized methodology to face each challenge: 

[Data acquisition -> Data cleaning -> Data analysis -> Algorithm implementation -> Algorithm applied to dataset -> further optimization and advanced topics] 

The notebooks cover a variety of topics and algorithms:

|  Algorithm  |           Model            |                       Topic         |
|-------------|:--------------------------:|--------------------------------------:|
| Recommender | Matrix Factorization - ALS | LastFM music-user-artist data         |
| Regression  |       Random Forests       |                Airplane Delay         |
| Simulation  |   MonteCarlo in TimeSeries        |                Finantial Risk         |
| Clustering  |       KMeans               | Network Traffic and Anomaly Detection |
| Clustering  |   KMeans in TimeSeries     |          Timeseries of NeuroImages    |

The last couple of notebooks belong to a **Challenge by SAFRAN**, two three-hour sessions that were part of their recruitment process. They served as the ultimate test to everything learnt beforehand, since no work was allowed out of the sessions.

## Details
* _Language_: Python over Jupyter Notebooks.
* _Execution_: set over a remote Spark cluster in [EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr/fr), managed by [Zoe](http://zoe-analytics.eu/)
* _Libraries_: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pyspark, thunder

The majority of the Notebooks are based on use cases illustrated in the book [Advanced Analytics with Spark](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035091.do), by Sandy Ryza, Uri Laserson, Sean Owen & Josh Wills.

The Notebooks are based on publicly available data.

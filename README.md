# Algorithmic Machine Learning
Portfolio of Machine Learning algorithms developed in 2017 over well known datasets for various purposes. 

* **Authors**: 
	* Ole Andreas Hansen @oleaha
	* Alberto Ibarrondo Luis @ibarrond

The projects cover a variety of topics and algorithms:

|  Algorithm  |           Model            |                       Dataset         |
|-------------|:--------------------------:|--------------------------------------:|
| Recommender | Matrix Factorization - ALS | LastFM music-user-artist data         |
| Regression  |       Random Forests       |                Airplane Delay         |
| Simulation  |         MonteCarlo         |                Finantial Risk         |
| Clustering  |       KMeans               | Network Traffic and Anomaly Detection |

## Details
* _Language_: Python over Jupyter Notebooks.
* _Execution_: set over a remote Spark cluster in [EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr/fr), managed by [Zoe](http://zoe-analytics.eu/)
* _Libraries_: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pyspark

## Sources and acknowledgments
The rough sketches of all the notebooks are the main focus of the course Algorithmic Machine Learning in EURECOM, and in particular [Pietro Michiardi](https://github.com/michiard)

The majority of the Notebooks are based on use cases illustrated in the book [Advanced Analytics with Spark](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035091.do), by Sandy Ryza, Uri Laserson, Sean Owen & Josh Wills.

The Notebooks are based on publicly available data.

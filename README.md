# Algorithmic Machine Learning
Portfolio of Machine Learning algorithms implemented in ipython notebooks over well known datasets for various purposes. 

The notebooks cover a variety of topics and algorithms:

|  Algorithm  |           Model            |                       Dataset         |
|-------------|:--------------------------:|--------------------------------------:|
| Recommender | Matrix Factorization - ALS | LastFM music-user-artist data         |
| Regression  |       Random Forests       |                Airplane Delay         |
| Simulation  |         MonteCarlo         |                Finantial Risk         |
| Clustering  |       KMeans               | Network Traffic and Anomaly Detection |
| Clustering  |       KMeans               |          Timeseries of NeuroImages    |

The last couple of notebooks come from a **Challenge by SAFRAN**, two three-hour sessions as part of their recruitment process. They served as the ultimate test to everything learnt beforehand, since no work was allowed out of the sessions.

The rough sketches of all the notebooks are the main focus of the course [Algorithmic Machine Learning](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsGroup/Algorithmic-Machine-Learning) in EURECOM, and in particular [Pietro Michiardi](https://github.com/michiard)

The majority of the Notebooks are based on use cases illustrated in the book [Advanced Analytics with Spark](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035091.do), by Sandy Ryza, Uri Laserson, Sean Owen & Josh Wills.

The Notebooks are based on publicly available data.
